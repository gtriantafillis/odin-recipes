# odin-recipes
This is for a lesson from The Odin Project.
We are going to make a simple website with some
recipes and stuff.
I will implement my HTML and CSS knowledge until
now.
Not sure how it is going to be when i'm finished
with the course.
I will probably come back and change this file's
contents.
